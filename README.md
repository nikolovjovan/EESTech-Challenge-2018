<b>Topic:</b> Big Data Analysis

## Task 1: Data gathering

Create a web crawler with a web scraper which gathers data from www.discogs.com. *Discogs* database contains a big amount of data about music albums all over the world, as well as many different details about those albums, and their authors. The database contains more than 9 million records. For the purposes of this competition it is required to gather all data from Serbia - about 8 thousand records, and Former Yugoslavian countries (SRB, MNE, SLO, CRO, BH, MAC) - about 43 thousand records. All gathered data should be stored in a MySQL or PostgreSQL database.

## Task 2: Data analysis

Analyze the gathered data by creating SQL queries and executing them on the database created as a result of task 1. Details of these queries are given in Serbian in the document in docs/ folder.

## Task 3: Data visualization

Visualize the gathered data using any available tool by creating SQL queries and showing the results using charts. Details of these queries are given in Serbian in the document in docs/ folder.
